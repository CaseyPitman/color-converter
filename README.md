# color-converter

JavaScript & jQuery

Another app made for a family member. My wife is a graphic designer and is constantly converting color values between HEX and RGB. I enjoyed the challenge of coding to validate the inputs as proper HEX or RGB values. I finally got a chance to put regular expressions to work and learned how to implement parseInt. I like how the background changes to the color the user inputs.
